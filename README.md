Hagibl - blogging engine for every hosting
==========================================

Information
-------------------------------------------

**Hagibl** is a new blog engine for any hosting. Hagibl is writen in JavaScript with JSON database file. Because of it all logic interpretes on client side and database can be transfered by simple copy-paste. But one complicated point is burried in engine's abbreviation. Hagible = **Ha**rdcore **Gi**thub **Bl**og, which means, that this engine is for hardcore internet users only.

For example, new post can be added by manual addition of new record directly into JSON database. All logic editing manually in `hagible.js` file, and all styling - in `hagible.css` file. All suggestions and found bugs you can send to bender@rodriges.org, or into project's bugtracker on github.com
